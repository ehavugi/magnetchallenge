To evaluate the relative error of your predicted results, please replace the files:

Volumetric_Loss_Material A.csv
Volumetric_Loss_Material B.csv
Volumetric_Loss_Material C.csv
Volumetric_Loss_Material D.csv
Volumetric_Loss_Material E.csv

with your own files generated by your model. 

Then execute the codes "Accuracy Evaluation.py". The codes will calculate and print the Average, the RMS, the 95th percentile, and the maximum of the relative errors on the testing set.
