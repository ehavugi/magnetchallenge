========================================================
## *** We have received many pre-submissions and are working on releasing the final test data. Please stay tuned. ***
========================================================
## *** Due to the upcoming ECCE 2023 travel and APEC 2024 deadlines, we will postpone the Preliminary Submission Date from 11-01-2023 to 11-10-2023, and the Final Submission Date from 12-24-2023 to 12-31-2023. ***
========================================================
## **MagNet Challenge 2023** [Pretest Evaluation Rules](pretest/FinalEvaluationRules.pdf) Here:

On November 10th, a preliminary test result is due to evaluate your already developed models for the 10 materials: 

- Step 1: Download the [MagNet Challenge Validation Data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4ppuzu7z4ky3m6l/AAApqXcxr_Fnr5x9f5qDr8j8a?dl=0) for the 10 existing materials each consisting of 5,000 randomly sampled data from the original database.

- Step 2: Use this database to evaluate your already-trained models.

- Step 3: Report your results following the provided [Template](pretest/PretestResultsPDF.pdf). Zip your Models and Results and send them to pelsmagnet@gmail.com.

We will use relative error to evaluate your models (the absolute error between the predicted and measured values).

$Percent\ Relative\  Error = \frac{\left |meas-pred \right |}{meas}\cdot100$ \%, where $meas$ is MagNet's Core Loss measurement and $pred$ is the model prediction.

The purpose of the preliminary test is to get you familiar with the final testing process. The preliminary test results have nothing to do with the final competition results. 

*** In the final test, we will provide a small or large dataset for training, and a small or large dataset for testing. The training and testing data for different materials may be offered in different ways to test the model's performance from different angles. ***

## Evaluation Timeline

- 06-15-2023 Evaluate the concept proposals and ensure all teams understand the competition rules.
- 11-10-2023 Evaluate the 10 models the teams developed for the 10 materials and provide feedback for improvements.
- 12-31-2023 Evaluate the 3 new models the teams developed for the 3 new materials and announce the winners.

## Evaluation Criterias

The judging committee will evaluate the results of each team with the following criterias.
- Model accuracy (30%): core loss prediction accuracy evaluated by 95th percentile error (lower error better)
- Model size (30%): number of parameters the model needs to store for each material (smaller model better)
- Model explanability (20%): explanability of the model based on existing physical insights (more explainable better)
- Model novelty (10%): new concepts or insights presented by the model (newer insights better)
- Software quality (10%): quality of the software engineering (more concise better)
