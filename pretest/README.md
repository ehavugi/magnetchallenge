## MagNet Challenge 2023 November Preliminary Test

On November 1st, a preliminary test result is due to evaluate your already developed models for the 10 materials: 

- Step 1: Download the [Data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4ppuzu7z4ky3m6l/AAApqXcxr_Fnr5x9f5qDr8j8a?dl=0) for the 10 existing materials each consisting of 5,000 randomly sampled data from the original database.

- Step 2: Use this database to evaluate your already-trained models.

- Step 3: Report your results following the provided [Template](PretestResultsPDF.pdf). Zip your Models and Results and send them to pelsmagnet@gmail.com.

We will use relative error to evaluate your models (the absolute error between the predicted and measured values).

$Percent\ Relative\  Error = \frac{\left |meas-pred \right |}{meas}\cdot 100$ \%, where $meas$ is MagNet's Core Loss measurement and $pred$ is the model prediction.

The purpose of the preliminary test is to get you familiar with the final testing process. The preliminary test results have nothing to do with the final competition results.
